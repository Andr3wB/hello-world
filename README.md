# hello-world
First repository - Following GitHub tutorial

Hello,
My name is Andrew. After 5 years of mechanical engineering, I discovered that my real passion for creating things lies in software development. I enjoyed the math and theory behind developing mechanical solutions, but the factory-based work enviornment and the ease at which other role's assignments could be delegated to mechnical engineers (slowly taking over the bulk of a mechanical engineer's workload) made me reconsider what I want to pursue over the length of my career. After looking around at the industry, the bulk of mechanical engineers that I talked to all were being delegated to more of a "manufacturing engineering" role, unless they pursued an additional technical degree to separate themselves from getting tangled into the day-today issues of a factory floor. Therefore, I am hoping to spin my career into a more software based engineering job, rather than the "manufacturing engineering" role that I saw my future going towards.

I aim to pursue CSS and Python as my primary languages, with some dabling in C thus far. I hope to get a little more familiarity with C++ and Java as well before graduating from the Masters in Computer Engineering degree I am currently enrolled in, which will come to an end at the end of 2018.

Looking forward to working with the GitHub community to further my programming education, and to hopefully contribute to something in a meaningful way over the course of 2018 and beyond!
